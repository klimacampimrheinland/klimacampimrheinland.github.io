DESCRIPTION:My contribution in the workshop will shed some light on the n
 otion of de-growth  (zuhd) from an Islamic perspective. It is intended t
 o frame an enlightened Islamic discourse to address this notion in light
  of market economy and consumerism. Islam as a way of life is seen to pr
 ovide remedies and insights to the national and global debate on growth 
 and sustainability. Islam views the role of the individual as a value-an
 d knowledge creator\, a steward\, witness\, and a reformer who strives t
 o contribute to progress and good life (Hayat Tayebah). To be able to ac
 hieve this\, we must develop new development models that are informed by
  both culture and ecology. Social equity\, good governance\, participati
 on\, de-growth\, conservation and protection are key principles in natur
 al resources  management in Islam. Islamic development model argues for 
 achieving prosperity without increasing the ecological footprints. \n\nI
 slamic worldview also provides new perspectives for discovering and expl
 aining the root causes for the current  environmental\, economic and soc
 ial crises as manifested in climate change\, water crisis\, poverty and 
 human security. Besides\, Islam views the root cause of global warming a
 nd water and ecological crisis is due to the absence or lack of human st
 ewardship and the deviation and departure from “natural state” or Fi
 tra. A framework for water sustainability which represents balance in th
 e five capitals (natural\, social\, financial\, manufactured\, and human
 ) will be outlined.
