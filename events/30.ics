DESCRIPTION:Participants will be encouraged to share and reflect upon per
 sonal and historical stories of\ncourage\, creativity and disobedience\,
  learn to trust each other and engage in horizontal\n6\nprocesses of org
 anising\, as well as explore tools for effective and creative strategies
  that are\nrequired in order to organise appropriate responses to the in
 justices of the climate\ncatastrophe.\nWe will use the Climate Games as 
 a case study to devise creative actions. Climate Games\nare a transmedia
  framework\, which during COP21\, will use both the cyberspace and the\n
 streets of Paris (or their own locality) as a huge playfield\, where tea
 ms will take action for\nclimate justice and against the toxic sludge of
  green capitalism.
