DESCRIPTION:\nMovements and NGOs have been fighting new coal plants in Eu
 rope since\n2006 but now the focus has begun to change: we need to shut 
 down existing coal plants\nand mines. This will take some strategic thin
 king and require\nmovements and NGOs to cooperate more closely. The work
 shop will give an overview of the current\ncoal situation in Europe. We 
 will discuss what strategies may help to\nshut down as many plants and m
 ines as possible.\nThe workshop will be in English (or German-as needed)
