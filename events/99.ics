DESCRIPTION:Climate change\nand gender justice are interrelated and funda
 mentally similar issues: to\nsuccessfully tackle climate change and gend
 er oppression at the root of the\nproblem will mean widespread structura
 l changes\, challenges to power relations\nand existing economic systems
 \, and transformative processes. Both will require\nus to change the way
  we think\, act and live our lives. \n\n\nLooking at the\nclimate proble
 m through a gender lens reveals not only that climate change will\nimpac
 t those most strongly who are most vulnerable and contributed least to t
 he\nproblem – something that is by now widely recognised in the climat
 e justice\nmovement. At the same time\, it can help us to understand tha
 t our attempts to find\nsolutions (whether in the international climate 
 negotiations or closer to home\,\nin locally-based climate activism) als
 o contain gender dimensions: whose voices\nare heard? How inclusive are 
 the practices we adopt? How can participation in\ndemocratic processes b
 e encouraged? And what could emancipatory practices look\nlike?\nThis wo
 rkshop will explore the ways in which climate justice and gender justice
 \nare related – particularly in reference to our own forms of climate 
 activism –\nand attempt to find some initial answers to the questions 
 above.
